# University Student-to-Supervisor Thesis Assigner

## Description

A Google App Script program to help the assignment process of thesis students to their supervisors using Google Spreadsheet and Google Form.

This application was a project for Maranatha Christian University (Universitas Kristen Maranatha), Faculty of Medicine. This project mainly aims to address some common problems in student-to-professor thesis assignment process:

1. Uncontrollable timeline of  the conventional way; resulting in unfair “races”

2. Fully booked supervisors are still flooded by student requests
